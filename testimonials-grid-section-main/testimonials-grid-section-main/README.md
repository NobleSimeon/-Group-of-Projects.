### What I learned

I learnt the power of grid


```html
```
```css
main {
    width: min(95%, 70rem);
    display: grid;
    gap: 20px;
    grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: 
    "one"
    "two"
    "three"
    "four"
    "five";
}
```
```js

```





### Useful resources

- [Learn grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This helped because it helped understand grid better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
